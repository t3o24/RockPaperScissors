The Rock Paper Scissors game is a classic game played between two players. The objective is to select one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors, and compare the choices to determine the winner. The project aims to develop console-based game using the C# programming language.

 The game allows two players (You and the computer) to compete against each other by making simultaneous choices of rock, paper, or scissors.The program then determines the winner based on the predefined rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

 The Rock Paper Scissors project incorporates the following features:

a. User Input: The program accepts user inputs for their choice of rock, paper, or scissors.

b. Random Computer Choice.

c. Win Determination: The program compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner.

d. Multiple Rounds: The game allows multiple rounds to be played until the players decide to quit.
